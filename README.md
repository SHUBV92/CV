## Profile

A recent graduate from Makers Academy learnt to program in JavaScript, Ruby using the Object Oriented Programming fundamentals. This also required me to utilise my teamwork and emotional intelligence. 

Previous experience working in the business sector, learning of the business problems introduced me to the technical realm. This has inspired me to initiate a career in tech by becoming a software developer and looking for opportunities where I can make change within this disruptive industry. 

As a person I am very curious to learn new technologies and meet great people that I can learn from which I was able to do at Makers.
